# Building a Developer Portfolio that Stands Out

When I set out to build this portfolio, I didn't just want a static showcase of projects. I wanted a platform that reflects my engineering philosophy: **clean, efficient, and scalable.**

This site is built with the latest web technologies to ensure performance and accessibility while delivering a premium user experience.

## The Tech Stack

I chose a modern stack that balances developer experience with end-user performance:

-   **Framework:** [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router) for server-side rendering and routing.
-   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a utility-first, maintainable design system.
-   **Animations:** [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for fluid, hardware-accelerated transitions.
-   **Email:** [Resend](https://resend.com/) + [React Email](https://react.email/) for a professional communication layer.
-   **Content:** MDX for writing blog posts (like this one!) in Markdown with React components.

## Key Features

### 1. Professional Dark Mode
Gone are the days of cluttered, "gamer" aesthetics. I opted for a **professional dark theme** using `zinc-950` backgrounds and subtle gradients. This ensures readability while maintaining a modern feel.

### 2. Contact Form with Resend
Instead of using generic `mailto` links, I integrated a fully functional contact form.
-   **Backend:** A server action (`sendEmail`) validates input using `Zod`.
-   **Delivery:** Resend API sends the email instantly.
-   **Feedback:** An auto-reply ("Receipt") is sent to the sender, confirming their message was received.

```typescript
// Example of the server action logic
import { Resend } from 'resend';

export const sendEmail = async (formData) => {
  const { name, email, message } = formData;
  await resend.emails.send({
    from: 'Portfolio <onboarding@resend.dev>',
    to: 'yash@example.com',
    subject: `New Contact: ${name}`,
    react: <ContactEmail name={name} message={message} />
  });
};
```

### 3. Dynamic Content
The "Projects" and "Testimonials" sections are designed to be scalable. Using React components, I can easily add new case studies or feedback without restructuring the page.

## What's Next?
I plan to expand this platform by:
-   Adding a dedicated **Case Studies** section.
-   Implementing **Cloudflare Turnstile** for spam protection.
-   Experimenting with **3D elements** using Three.js for specific interaction points.

Stay tuned as I continue to ship updates!
