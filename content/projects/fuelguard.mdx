# FuelGuard: Revolutionizing Fleet Management

Fuel theft is a critical issue for logistics companies. **FuelGuard** addresses this with a dual-layer approach: hardware sensors for precision monitoring and a cloud dashboard for real-time analytics.

## The Challenge
Fleet owners were losing **15-20% of operational costs** due to pilferage and inefficient routes. Existing solutions were either too expensive or lacked real-time alerts.

## The Solution
We built a custom **ESP32-based hardware unit** with ultrasonic sensors to measure fuel levels with 99% accuracy. This data is transmitted via **MQTT** to a secure **Next.js dashboard**.

### Key Features
-   **Real-time Alerts:** Instant SMS/Email on sudden fuel drops.
-   **Geofencing:** Alerts if fuel is accessed outside designated zones.
-   **Analytics:** Historical trends and efficiency reports.

## Tech Stack Deep Dive
-   **Hardware:** ESP32, Ultrasonic Sensors, GSM Module.
-   **Backend:** Node.js, MQTT Broker (HiveMQ).
-   **Frontend:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Recharts.
