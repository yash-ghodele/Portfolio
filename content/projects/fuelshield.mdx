# FuelShield: Stopping Fuel Theft Before It Happens

**FuelShield** bridges the gap between embedded hardware and modern web systems. It is an end-to-end IoT solution designed to make silent fuel theft visible, measurable, and actionable.

## ⚠️ The Problem: Silent Losses

Fuel theft is one of the most expensive problems for logistics companies.
*   **Invisible:** Traditional fuel logs and manual audits fail to detect real-time pilferage.
*   **Costly:** Fleets lose **15-20%** of operational costs to theft and inefficiency.
*   **Delayed:** By the time a discrepancy is noticed in a monthly audit, the money is gone.

## 💡 The Solution: Real-Time Telemetry

We built a system that reacts instantly.
*   **Precision:** Ultrasonic sensors measure fuel levels with **99% accuracy**.
*   **Speed:** **MQTT** events trigger alerts in sub-second time.
*   **Intelligence:** Geofencing detects if fuel is accessed outside designated zones.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system operates on a 3-layer architecture:

1.  **Hardware Layer (Edge):** An **ESP32** microcontroller polls ultrasonic sensors to calculate fuel volume. It filters sensor noise locally before transmitting data.
2.  **Communication Layer (MQTT):** Data is published to a HiveMQ broker. This lightweight protocol ensures reliable delivery even over 2G/GPRS networks.
3.  **Application Layer (Next.js):** A real-time dashboard consumes these events, visualizing fuel drops on live charts and triggering SMS/Email alerts.

### Key Capabilities
*   **10-Second Updates:** Live tracking of fuel levels.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Algorithms distinguish between "sloshing" (movement) and "sudden drops" (theft).
*   **Historical Analytics:** Visualizing trends to identify inefficient vehicles or routes.

## 💻 Tech Stack Deep Dive

### MQTT & Real-Time Data
We chose **MQTT** over HTTP for its low overhead and "Keep-Alive" capabilities, essential for maintaining connection with moving trucks.

```typescript
const client = mqtt.connect(BROKER_URL);

// Listen for sensor anomalies
client.on('message', (topic, message) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(message.toString());
    
    // Check for sudden fuel drop
    if (data.drop_rate > THRESHOLD) {
        // Trigger critical alert
        sendAlert({
            truckId: data.id,
            location: data.gps,
            severity: 'CRITICAL'
        });
    }
});
```

### Hardware Logic (ESP32)
The edge device runs a **Kalman Filter** algorithm to smooth out sensor noise caused by vehicle vibration, ensuring that alerts are only triggered by genuine fuel loss events.

## 🚀 Impact

*   **Savings:** Reduced overall fuel expenses by **20%** for a test fleet of 50 vehicles.
*   **Precision:** Achieved **99%** sensor accuracy compared to manual dipstick measurements.
*   **Accountability:** Provided irrefutable data evidence for driver disputes.
