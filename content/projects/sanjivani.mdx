# Sanjivani: AI for Agriculture

Empowering farmers with instant, accurate crop disease diagnosis using just their smartphone camera.

## The Challenge
Early detection of crop diseases is vital for food security. Traditional lab testing is slow and expensive for small-scale farmers.

## The Solution
**Sanjivani** uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on a dataset of 50,000+ leaf images. The model runs on a Flask backend, accessible via a React-based PWA.

### Impact
-   **Speed:** Diagnosis in < 2 seconds.
-   **Accuracy:** 98% validated against expert assessment.
-   **Accessibility:** Works offline (cached model) for remote areas.
