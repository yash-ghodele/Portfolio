**Badge:** Overview
**Title:**## Professional Profile 👨‍💻

### **Builder-First Identity**
**Opening Statement:**
> "I don't just build projects — I design systems that have to work in the real world. My work sits at the intersection of embedded systems, software platforms, and execution — where hardware fails, users behave unpredictably, and timelines are non-negotiable."

**Key Positioning:**
- **Not** student-first, **builder-first**
- Focus on real-world constraints and execution
- Demonstrates thinking through friction

### **Context (Not Identity)**
Currently pursuing B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering at MIT College of Engineering, but primary learning comes from:
- Building and running real systems
- IoT security platforms
- Large-scale student hackathons with 200+ participants

### **Earned Leadership**
Leadership emerged from execution pressure:
- Organizing events like **InnoHack** taught system behavior under stress
- Coordination breaks, assumptions fail
- **Clarity > Speed** when systems are under pressure

---

## Key Focus Areas 🎯

These areas **naturally converge** rather than existing in parallel:

### 1. **IoT & Embedded Systems**
Designing devices that interact with unpredictable environments

### 2. **Full Stack Platforms**
Building software layers that make hardware usable

### 3. **System Execution & Events**
Structuring people, processes, and timelines so systems actually ship

## Core Competencies (Feature Cards) ⚡

### 1. **Embedded Systems & Devices**
**Icon:** Zap (Primary color)
**Description:** Building IoT solutions with ESP32, Arduino, and sensors that operate in unpredictable real-world conditions.

### 2. **Team & System Leadership**
**Icon:** Users (Purple)
**Description:** Leading teams through execution pressure — InnoHack (200+ participants), BotBuddies, and ECESA technical communities.

### 3. **Execution & Tradeoffs**
**Icon:** Lightbulb (Blue)
**Description:** Making systems ship under real constraints — balancing scope, timelines, and team coordination when assumptions break.

## Design Philosophy

The section uses a **deconstructed grid layout**:
- **Left Column (7/12):** Main biographical content
- **Right Column (5/12):** Floating feature cards

This creates visual interest while maintaining readability and hierarchy.

## Visual Effects

1. **Animations:**
   - Slide in from left (main bio)
   - Slide in from right (features)
   - Hover translate effects on feature cards

2. **Glow Effects:**
   - Behind each feature icon
   - Intensifies on hover

3. **Color Coding:**
   - Primary (IoT Development)
   - Purple (Team Leadership)
   - Blue (Strategic Planning)
